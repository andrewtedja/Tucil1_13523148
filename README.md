## üìù Description

This project is a solution finder for the IQ Puzzler Pro game implemented using a pure Bruteforce Algorithm in Java. The goal of IQ Puzzler Pro is to fill an empty board of (N x M) with uniquely shaped puzzle pieces, ensuring all pieces are used without heuristics. The program reads the input and test case files (.txt), finds a valid configuration (or report validation in terminal if none exists), and provides solution/execution details such as runtime, iteration/cases count, and a feature for file saving. This project is made both in CLI and GUI with (Maven and JavaFX).

## ü™õ Pre-requisites

-   **Running Java**: JDK 11 or higher (tested on JDK 17)
-   **Running Java supported IDE**: IDE for building project (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode)
-   **Running OS**: compatible with Windows and Linux
-   **Maven**: For dependency management

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHow to Run

1. **Install Java**: Download and install Java from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
2. **Install Maven**: Download and install Maven from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
3. **Clone the Repository**: Use one of the following commands to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andrewtedja/Tucil1_13523148.git
    ```

4. **Build the Project**: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to build the project:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

5. **Run the Project**: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to run the project:

    ```bash
    mvn javafx:run
    ```

## Features

-   Reading file input upload from (.txt) file
-   Solving the IQPuzzler Pro using Brute force Algorithm
-   Showing information on board size (rows, columns), type of puzzle (Default/Custom/Pyramid), and the number of puzzle pieces
-   Show the solving process in both GUI and CLI (debug mode)
-   Show the solution of the board in both GUI and CLI, and also the statistics for runtime and iteration cases of the solving process
-   Allows user to save the solution in the in both matrix form (test/output.txt) and also image (test/solution.png)
